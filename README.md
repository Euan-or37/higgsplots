# Higgs Boson Data Analysis â€“ CERN 2012 Dataset

This project explores and analyzes real collision data released by CERN in 2012, related to the discovery of the Higgs boson particle. Using public datasets from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), this analysis replicates aspects of the statistical evidence presented in the original discovery papers.

## Objective
To demonstrate the statistical signature of the Higgs boson particle by analyzing decay channels and invariant mass distributions from the CMS and ATLAS experiments.

## Data Source
- CERN Open Data Portal
- 2012 public data release related to Higgs boson events

## Methods Used
- Data cleaning and transformation
- Visualization of particle collision outcomes
- Histogramming invariant mass values
- Statistical fitting (e.g., Gaussian over background)
- Signal vs background comparison

## Tools & Libraries
- Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy)
- Jupyter Notebook
- CERN root data converted via `root_numpy` / `uproot`

## Results
The analysis reveals a clear bump in the invariant mass distribution around 125 GeV, consistent with the Higgs boson signature reported by CERN in 2012.
